            <p>This film tells about the father of Dom Torreto, Jack Toretto participates in a car race with his sons Dom and Jakob who work as his pit crew. Dom doesn't like the tactics of his rival, namely Kenny Linder. While racing, Linder's car hits Jack Toretto's rear bumper and sends his car flying. The car crashed and immediately burst into flames. Jack is instantly killed. A week later, Jack Torreto's son, Dominic Torreto was arrested for violently assaulting Linder. While in prison, Dom remembers that Jakob was working on his father's car on the day he died and deduces that his brother had a hand in their father's death. After Dom is released from prison, Dom confronts his brother and challenges him to a street race. Dom demands that if he wins, Jakob must leave town and never come back.</p>
            <p>Later in 2019, two years after Dom and his team battled the cyber terrorist named Cipher, Dom retired from street racing and world travel and stayed home to raise his young son Brian with his wife Letty Ortiz. While relaxing, Dom and Letty are visited by Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey who are Torreto's friends. The three tell Dom and Letty that his superior's plane, called Mr. Nobody is attacked by an unknown rogue agent while in flight after capturing Cipher. The plane crashed in Montequinto, Central America. Letty agrees to help, but Dom insists that he doesn't want to come. However, when he watches Mr. Nobody's final video of being attacked, Dom realizes that Jakob is in fact the evil agent.</p>
            <p>Dom's team searches for the plane while avoiding the military in the country. Once they found the plane, they searched for a tool called Project Aries. Project Aries provides its users with the ability to hack into any computer-controlled system. Team Torreto is ambushed by private soldiers led by Jakob. Dom's team flees the country and meets their agent Michael Stasiak, to help Dom set up a base of operations in their safe house. Dom's sister Mia comes to help after she hears that Jakob is involved. Her husband Brian stayed behind to look after their children. During their investigation into Project Aries, they find out that their old deceased friend Han Lue is connected to the project.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Jakob meets his business partner and financier, Otto. They plot their next move to steal the other half of the Aries Project. The imprisoned Cipher informs Jakob that his other half is in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Dom continues his search for his brother and contacts his father's former crew chief, Buddy, and it turns out that Buddy was the one who took care of Jakob after he left town. Buddy tells Dom that Jakob is in London.</p>
            <p>In Tokyo, Letty and Mia find Han, who is still alive. Han has taken on the task of protecting Elle, a child he saved when he was young. At the same time, Roman and Tej recruited Sean Boswell, Twinkie, and Earl Hu, to help the team. The three use their combined skills to create a rocket car which they find difficult to perfect. In London, Dom encounters Queenie Magdalene Ellmanson-Shaw who informs Dom of Jakob's specific location. Dom goes to Otto's father's house and meets his brother and Otto. However, Otto uses his father's diplomatic immunity to arrest Dom. Dom is released when the arrest officer turns out to be Leysa, Dom's old friend.</p>
            <p>Some time later, Tej, Roman and Ramsey meet up with Dom in Edinburgh. At the same time, Jakob uses a massive electromagnet to steal the other half of Project Aries. Roman and Tej find a truck filled with electromagnets by accident. However, Otto's men catch them. Ramsey jumps in the truck to chase Otto, even though he is unable to drive a car. As he starts the truck, he accidentally triggers an electromagnet which disables Otto's men guarding Roman and Tej. Dom chases after Jakob who is zip-lining across town. The two fight each other on rooftops and then take to the streets. Otto moves to intercept Jakob, but his car is run over by Ramsey. Ramsey also uses an electromagnet to catch Jakob.</p>
            <p>Once there, Han arrives with Letty and Han. He reveals that he was assigned by Mr. Nobody to protect Elle and Project Aries. It is revealed that Elle's DNA is the key to the activation of Project Aries. Mr. Nobody finds out that one of his agents is treason, and is later revealed to be Jakob, so it is Mr. Nobody who uses Deckard Shaw to fake Han's death so he can escape attention to protect Elle.</p>
            <p>Otto attacks Dom's safe house and frees Jakob. Jakob reveals that he used the safe house before when he worked for Mr. Nobody. He also tells Dom that their father was trying to have a race in which he died to escape his huge debt. Jakob reveals that their father had instructed young Jakob to damage the car so he would lose. Jakob and Otto kidnap Elle and take the other half of Project Aries. They leave Dom and his team to be executed, however, Dom's team uses electromagnets to disable Otto's weapons and escape.</p>
            <p>Dom's team works together to stop Otto and Jakob. Otto launches a satellite into space, while Jakob has Elle activate Project Aries. Jakob uploads Aries to a satellite while driving through Tbilisi in an inconspicuous armored 16 wheeler. Dom jumps into action using their street racing skills to stop the terrorists. Mia and Han try to break through the truck. Otto betrays Jakob and throws him out of the truck. Dom and Mia rescue Jakob, and in return, Jakob helps Dom into the truck. At the same time. Tej and Roman use Sean's team's rocket car to enter orbit and destroy the satellite that stopped Otto's upload.</p>
            <p>Without Dom and Jakob Knowing, Cipher, who is now working with Otto, has betrayed everyone. He bombed the truck using a drone fighter. He nearly kills Dom, but he uses the truck to destroy the drone before Cipher can take a second shot. Cipher, now free from his captivity, escapes again into the underworld. Dom's entire team survives with Jakob's help. Dom and Mia reconcile with their brother before he leaves for an unknown destination. Tej and Roman reach the International Space Station and return safely to Earth.</p>
            <p>At the last minute, Letty and Dom return to Dom's family home in Los Angeles. They have a big barbecue dinner with all of the team and Dom's family. Before they sit down to say hello, Brian stopped in the driveway showing him rejoining his family.</p>
            <p>In the end, Deckard Shaw is working out with a punching bag, then after he finished his training, he opened his bag and revealed Otto who was willing to provide information to Deckard. There was a knock on the door and Deckard answered it. Deckard looks shocked to see Han alive in the doorway.</p>
