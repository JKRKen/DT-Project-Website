In the 1930s, Kiichiro Toyoda realizes the potential of the car industry and thought to change his family business. He traveled to the United States to study the car manufacturing process and understand the principles behind mass production. Inspired by what he learned, he returned to Japan with the vision of creating a Japanese car manufacture company.</p>
            <p>     In 1937, Toyoda founded Toyota Motor Corporation, and his first car is produced in 1936.
